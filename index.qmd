# Preface {.unnumbered}

These are my study notes on training DNA/RNA/Protein and other biomedical language models. The text/book is intended for people who want to casually explore the field before they on-ramp to actually training large DNA/Biological language models, or for their PIs, an anxious aging millennial or bitter but wise gen-X'ers who want to be able to understand the next generation of computational genomics that is about to wash over us all.

At all times I'll try to add minimal biological context (though I am no biologist!) for people who have an ML background but no college bio experience and ill try to add context on ML concepts for those with a bio background but limited experience with language models.

## Acknowledgements

These notes are written by me, Michel Nivard, a professor of Epidemiology at the University of Bristol, and as this book is not a core outputs for my job, I rely heavily on LLMs to help me with spelling and formatting.

These study notes are influences by discussion with Robbee Wedow and Seyedeh Zahra Paylakhi with whom I work on relate projects.
