# Preface {.unnumbered}

These are my study notes on training DNA/RNA/Protein and other biomedical language models. The text/book is intended for people who want to casually explore the field before they on-ramp to actually training large DNA/Biological language models, or for their PIs, an anxious aging millennial or bitter but wise gen-X'ers who want to be able to understand the next generation of computational genomics that is about to wash over us all.

At all times I'll try to add minimal biological context (though I am no biologist!) for people who have an ML background but no college bio experience and ill try to add context on ML concepts for those with a bio background but limited experience with language models.

## The times we live in.

More than natural language models biologial/sequence language models rely heavily on NIH funded databases, datasets, resources and scientits. The data we train on was bought and payd for by taxpayers all over the globe. The Human Genome Project was to a great extend funded, directed and conceived under the auspice of the US federal government, under both Democratic and Republican presidents. Had they not, pharmasuitical companies might have done it, and while thoes can be highly innovative there would  have been no space for startups, no space for Google Deep-mind to come in and itterate, revolutionize or grow biological modeling. There is nu uproar over trainign data in biology because under the firm guidance of US federal policy all the data sequencers generate is generally in the public domain, ar accessible for those willing and able to meet ethical standards. All scientits readign this know this, should you find yourself as someone from silicon valley, from a well funded startup even, take a beat and think through whether you'd stand a snowballs chance in hell to compete if the next wave of sequence data isnt public but generated inside google/microsoft/pharma. Then adjust your politics accordingly.

These notes are written by me, Michel Nivard, a professor of Epidemiology at the University of Bristol, and as this book is not a core outputs for my job, I rely on LLMs to help me with drafting, spelling and formatting.
