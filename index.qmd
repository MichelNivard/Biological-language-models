# Preface {.unnumbered}

These are study notes I take while exploring how to train DNA/RNA/Protein language models. **Chapter one covers** downloading (DNA) sequences data from ensembl and uploading it to Huggingface. **Chapter two covers** training a first small DNA sequence language model.

These notes are written by me, Michel Nivard, and as this book is not a core outputs for my job, I rely heavily on LLMs to help me with spelling and formatting.

These study notes are influences by discussion with Robbee Wedow and Seyedeh Zahra Paylakhi with whom I work on relate projects.
